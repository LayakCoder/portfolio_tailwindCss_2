The website is built using modern web technologies such as **HTML**, **CSS**, **TailwindCSS**, and **Swiper** to create an engaging and user-friendly experience.

- **Services Section**: A section that highlights the services offered, such as Frontend Design, with images and descriptions.
- **Projects Section**: Showcase of recent web development projects.
- **Testimonials Section**: A dynamic swiper carousel displaying feedback from clients.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structure and content of the site.
- **TailwindCSS**: For styling the page with utility-first classes.
